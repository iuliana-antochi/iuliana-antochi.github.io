            <h2> About me </h2>
            <p> Hi! I'm Iuliana and I aspire to become a front-end developer. Once I realized my previous job doesn't suit me and didn't bring joy, I've started to look up on "How to become a front-end developer?"</p>

            <p>The internet has unlimited resources, but I've chosen to start by enrolling to the <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/" target="_blank"> Bootcamp</a> available on <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/" target="_blank"> Frondend Masters</a> website. This Bootcamp taught me the basic of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and after finishing it, I felt like I want to do this more. </p>
            
            <p>So, I've started to search for my next resource and decided to join the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path" target="_blank">Front-End Engineer Career Path</a> from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. It's a hard, but fun journey where I've learned a lot of interesting things including making this portfolio you're reading right now.</p>

            <p>In my free time I love to play with my cat, Dora and cooking new recipes or baking delicious cakes. Another passion would be photography, but this requires a lot of time and travel, which are not possible for me right now. Furthermore, I'd love to learn to crochet and knit, hopefully I can do that in the near future.</p>
